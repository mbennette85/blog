        First day went well. We all introduced ourselves, thanked God for being here and then listened to a lecture from the codemaster. There was definately an emphasis on teamwork and staying focused. I'm excited and anxiious as well.

        Second day went well. We relaxed as we watched Cohort 11 present their projects for the 3 month period. Very good concepts and ideas were shown and it excites me to be able to have that mastery in 3 months!!!!!
